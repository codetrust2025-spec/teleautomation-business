"""The mask that actually arrives is dots, not bullets.

Google Pay draws the payee as "••••1111@ybl". The extractor transcribes those
bullets as full stops, so what reaches the validator is ".....1111@ybl" -- five
U+002E, read straight out of the production rejection log for Sowmya's upload:

    receiver_name='J RAVINDER' receiver_upi='.....1111@ybl' receiver_account=''
    sender_upi='.....2761@okaxis' amount=5000 status='SUCCESS'
    txn='661139834383' match='' conflict=True

The mask class did not include the period, so the string was not recognised as
redacted. Dots are legal inside a real VPA local part, so `_valid_upi` then
accepted ".....1111@ybl" as a genuine handle -- one that matches no registered
account while the receiver NAME matches one, which is exactly the state that
raises a receiver-identity conflict. A payment to a registered account was
refused for not being to a registered account.

Every payload here is the logged one. Nothing is transcribed from a screenshot
by eye, which is how the two previous attempts at this went wrong.
