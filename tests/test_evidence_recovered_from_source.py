"""The proof has to be in the mail, not in the sentence the model happened to pick.

The Karat reminder was classified INTERVIEW_CONFIRMED correctly and then thrown
away as EVIDENCE_DOES_NOT_ENTAIL_TRANSITION. Every excerpt the model cited had
to entail the transition itself, and the one it chose described the interview's
*format*:

    "Your interview will be a live video call lasting approximately 60 minutes
     in our interactive coding environment, Karat Studio."

That proves nothing about the interview being scheduled. The sentence that does
was sitting in the same body, unquoted:

    "This is a quick reminder that your Altimetrik interview for the Citi
     Scaled Hiring FPC - NAM project is coming up soon!"

So a correct classification hung on which sentence the model reached for.

The rule is unchanged: an entailing, verbatim excerpt is still required. It is
now looked for in the verified source rather than only among the model's picks,
which is why a rejection, a job advert or a format-only mail still recovers
nothing and stays rejected.
