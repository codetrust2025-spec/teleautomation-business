"""A mail the AI could not quote properly is reviewed, not discarded.

Two different failures were landing in the same silent ignore:

  1. the mail says no such thing -- a rejection, a job advert. Rightly ignored.
  2. the mail does say it, and the model paraphrased instead of quoting. The
     anti-hallucination guard refuses to trust a non-verbatim quote, which is
     correct, and the outcome was that a real interview disappeared as "not
     offer related".

The Karat reminder was the second kind: its single cited excerpt matched the
body for 120 characters and then diverged, so nothing was verbatim, so
`supported` was empty and the classification was thrown away silently.

The guard is unchanged. Nothing auto-books without verified verbatim evidence
that entails the transition. The second case now goes to Needs Review, where a
human can see it.
