"""The Mail Alerts filter offers two groups; together they must mean "all".

The screen replaced a dropdown of eighteen classifications with "Selection
Related" and "Interview Related". That only works if the two groups partition
the tracked set exactly: every tracked classification in one group, none in
both. Otherwise an alert type added later belongs to neither, and it vanishes
from a filtered screen while still being counted in the totals — with nothing
failing anywhere.

The frontend asserts the same property over its own copy of the lists
(MailAlertsFilters.test.jsx). Both are needed: the browser decides which
options exist, the server decides which rows come back, and a mismatch between
them shows up as a filter that returns nothing.
