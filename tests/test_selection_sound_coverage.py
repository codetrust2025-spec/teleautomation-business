"""Every Selection Related alert must be able to make a sound.

The backend's selection group and the dashboard's sound list were maintained
separately and drifted: `final_round_cleared` and `hr_confirmation` were in
core/recruitment_mail_store.py but in neither list in mailAlertSound.js, so
isTrackedMailAlert() returned false and those alerts landed on the Selection
Related tab in silence. Nothing failed, nothing logged - the alert was simply
only visible to someone already looking at the screen.

The lists live in two languages, so nothing but a test can hold them together.
