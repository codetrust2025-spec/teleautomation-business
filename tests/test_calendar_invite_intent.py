"""A calendar invite proves when an event is, not that it is an interview.

One real candidate was auto-booked into "ChatGPT & 10+ AI Tools - IND" from a
Zoom workshop registration. The registration carried a perfectly valid RFC5545
invite, and `process_message` took the calendar result and never called
`analyze()` at all -- so no model ever judged what the mail was. An operator
cancelled the slot three days later.

The `.ics` remains the authority on the schedule and keeps its priority: 77 of
91 confirmed interviews come from one, and the parser is exact where prose is
not. What is added is a question the invite cannot answer -- is this event this
candidate's interview -- and it is put to Ollama, whose relevance prompt already
names webinars, masterclasses, training and public events explicitly.

The gate is deliberately not the deterministic shortcut. That shortcut answered
ESTABLISHED / RECIPIENT_HIRING_PROCESS for three handwriting-therapy webinars,
which is exactly the judgement being tested.
