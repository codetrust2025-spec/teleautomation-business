"""Read-only reconciliation of recorded received amounts against proof evidence.

This never writes. It exists so the mismatch between what was typed and what the
proofs show can be reviewed before any record is corrected.

Rows are split into two kinds, because they need different decisions:

* `evidenced` — the candidate has payment proofs, so the proof total is
  authoritative and a difference is a defect to correct.
* `unevidenced` — money was recorded but no proof was ever captured. Most of the
  historical roster is in this state. These are listed for visibility only;
  treating an empty proof list as ₹0 would erase real payments.
