/**
 * The date control must not widen the Daily Ops controls row.
 *
 * That row is already wider than its container at 1440px before this control
 * exists — measured at 1155px of content in a 1142px box — and it lays out
 * with `overflow: visible` above 1101px. So every pixel the date control takes
 * beyond the text it shows comes off the far end of the row, where the Refresh
 * button sits: an early version fixed the control at 176px, 78px more than the
 * month dropdown it replaced, and Refresh was cut off by the viewport edge.
 *
 * Two things keep it honest, and asserting only one leaves the bug reachable:
 *
 *   1. the control is sized to its own label, not to a fixed width
 *   2. the label itself is never given a fixed width either, or `max-content`
 *      on the trigger would be overruled by `.ops-roster-control .cand-input`
 *
 * Assertions are on the stylesheet: jsdom performs no layout, so a rendered
 * width check would pass whatever these rules said. The rendered behaviour is
 * covered against a real browser instead.
